## 👀 About

This Simulator is an interactive sandbox designed for developers to explore the potential of the [GenLayer Protocol](https://genlayer.com/). It replicates the GenLayer network's execution environment and consensus algorithm, but offers a controlled and local environment to test different ideas and behaviors.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the GenLayer CLI, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/): Required to run the GenLayer environment. **Required version**: Docker 26+

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/): Needed for the GenLayer CLI tool. **Required version**: Node.js 18+

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
```


## 🛠️ Installation GenLayer Simulator

```
npm install -g genlayer
genlayer init
```

To run genlayer again just run:

```
genlayer up
```

After executing those commands a new tab will open in your browser with the GenLayer Simulator. Additional installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.genlayer.com/simulator/installation)

## 🚀 Key Features
* 🖥️ **Test Locally:** Developers can test Intelligent Contracts in a local environment, replicating the GenLayer network without the need for deployment. This speeds up the development cycle and reduces the risk of errors in the live environment.

* 🧪 **Versatile Scenario Testing:** The simulator allows developers to create and test contracts under various simulated network conditions. This includes stress testing under high transaction loads, simulating network delays, and testing different consensus outcomes.

* 🔄 **Changeable LLM Validators:** Developers can modify the large language models (LLMs) used by validators within the simulator. This allows for testing of security, efficiency, and accuracy by running different LLMs to validate transactions.


## 📖 The Docs
Detailed information of how to use the simulator can be found at [GenLayer Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/).
